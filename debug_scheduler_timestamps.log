Creating Debug Patches for SGLang
============================================================
✅ Created scheduler_debug_patch.txt
✅ Created output_processor_debug_patch.txt
✅ Created tokenizer_manager_debug_patch.txt
✅ Created apply_debug_patches.sh

============================================================
Debug patches created!
============================================================

Next steps:
1. Review the patch files:
   - scheduler_debug_patch.txt
   - output_processor_debug_patch.txt
   - tokenizer_manager_debug_patch.txt

2. Apply the patches to your SGLang installation
3. Restart servers with --log-level info
4. Run a test and check server logs for [DEBUG] messages

This will help identify where the timestamps are getting lost
